<h2 align="center">The program should allow the user to create / pass tests of varying complexity</h2>

* The test includes a topic -> subtopic -> sub-topic *
* Ability to create a test at a time
* Ability to create different types of tests, which may include different types of questions (open / closed, etc.)
* Ability to grade the test by the total (as well as the ability to mark the answer as correct / incorrect immediately or after the end of the test)
* Ability to view statistics on topics and subtopics (the correctness of the answers received, the number of tests, etc.)

<h2 align="center">Basic requirements for the program</h2>

>User interface. The user must be able to interact with the program as follows:
1. When starting the program, there should be a welcome window with general information about the application
2. The user must be able to create tests, delete or edit existing ones, as well as pass ready-made tests
3. All user responses should be processed to obtain further statistics
4. Each test question must have an answer (which one depends on the type of question)
5. It should be possible to view the correct answers at the end of the test with an overall mark on the total
6. You can use serializable or databases
7. The ability to differentiate between logic, interface, and data handling is a big plus for the program.
